# IterativeAnalyticalQueryProcessing
The above procedure is generated by extending the query number in TPC-DS benchmark. The TPC-DS procedure is generated based on scalar parameters.

For each scalar parameter that is used in the query template, the loop, which calculates the query iteratively for every range of parameter, is inserted. For the experiments using the benchmark procedures, we created three databases with different sizes: 10 GB, 50 GB, and 100 GB. Then, we observed the scalability of the proposed algorithm using these different database sizes. In addition, we show that the performance of the algorithm varies according to the table statistics, even for the same procedure.

This TPC-DS benchmark show significant improvements in terms of execution time compared with the state-of-the-art work.

In this paper, we proposed a new code motion that considers both the quality of the query plans and the impact of loop invariant code motions. This paper also proposed a cost model that estimates the benefit of a query motion by using the loop iteration count and the query execution cost.
